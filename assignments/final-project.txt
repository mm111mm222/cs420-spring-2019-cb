Final Project 

Quick and Dirty Point of Sale Program

This should be written using Node.js.

Due on May 8th.  You will demo in class starting at 4:30 PM

- Products/Items
    - SKU
    - Description
    - Picture/Image
    - Price
    - Quantity Available

    Products/Items need to managed with CRUD (Create/Update/Delete) activities
    A list view of the items available in the system

- Sale/Transaction
    - Set customer / or "Johny Cash"
    - Add Items / Qty to transaction
    - Calculate Sales Tax
    - Calculate Total (Sales Tax + (Item Price * Qty))
    - Tender / Pay for Transaction `
        - Cash
        - Credit Card
        - Etc
    - Transaction is persisted to file
    - Nice to have support for discounts (Straight percentage or dollar value off)

- Customer (US Based)
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Street Address
    - City
    - State 
    - Zip Code
    - Phone Number

- Data Storage Layer
    - Should be NoSQL Based Model
    - File Based Storage, but do MongoDB if you feel like Item

How the application flow should be
    - POS should start in a mode to start a transaction - Transaction Mode.
    - You should have an "Admin" screen that allows you to manage items / customer
    - Transaction mode should allow you to add start/clear a sale
